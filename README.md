to implement and run the code-
-> create a folder 'StudentImages' and save the photos with the actual name of the student, as the system takes the name value from image name itself
->create a .csv file(which is attendance.new here) and provide it with name and roll no. of students
->after running the code, your attendance record will be saved in the excel file whose path you gave(here attendancenew.xlsx)

this is how the the system UI loos like
